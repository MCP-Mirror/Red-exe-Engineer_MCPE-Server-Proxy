# MCPE-Server-Proxy
This helps with joining MCPI servers on MCPE

Put the folder in the qpython/projects3 and name it to whatever server name you have preset

The scipt will work without a preset but please use one, you can have one for each server if you want

To set a preset just replace the None in line 7 of main.py to have the server address in quotes around it

You may need QPython 3L, here is the link:
